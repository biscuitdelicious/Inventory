# 📚 My Portfolio App
Welcome to my Portfolio App! This is a personal project where I share cool stuff I’ve discovered and want to highlight. 
From **books and bikes to media and more**, this app is a collection of things I find interesting and **worth sharing**.

also showcasing my programming skills. 
This app is a part of my portfolio, demonstrating my ability to combine **creativity with functionality**.
